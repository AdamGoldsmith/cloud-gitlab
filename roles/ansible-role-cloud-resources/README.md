# ansible-role-cloud-resources

Deploys cloud resources and services on various cloud providers defined by supplied data variables.

## Supported Cloud Providers

* GCP

## GCP actions

Actions are based on a supplied "services" structure defined in a `project_data` dictionary. If correct credentials are supplied, by default the following actions will be performed (see default [role variables](#role-variables) section):

* Create "base" service resources:
    * Create VPC network
    * Create external address
    * Create common firewall rules
* Create "bastion" service resources:
    * Create VPC network
    * Create external address dedicated to bastion instance
    * Create bastion instance boot disk
    * Create bastion instance

Currently tested on these Operating Systems
* CentOS 8

## Requirements

* Ansible 2.5 or higher

      scopes:
        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute
```

As described above, the default `project_data` configuration will deploy a base project with a project-wide VPC network, an external IP address for accessing services via port-forwarding rules, and a bastion SSH instance with a dedicated external address for managing internal, non internet-facing instances. If you now wanted to add a new instance that will be hosting a web service on port 80, you could run this role with the following components added to the `project_data['services']` dictionary:

```yaml
    web:                                                                        # "web" service resource dictionary
      instances:                                                                # List of instance dictionaries
        - name: 1                                                               # Name of instance (converted to "<service>-<name>-vm", eg "`web-1-vm`")
          disk:                                                                 # Boot disk data dictionary
            size_gb: 20                                                         # Size of disk to create (minimum 20)"

          machine_type: n1-standard-1                                           # VM's machine type
          zone: "{{ project_region }}-a"                                        # Zone in which to create the instance
          create_external_ip: no                                                # Do not create an associated external address
      target_pool_data:                                                         # List of target pool dictionaries for accessing internally-hosted services from the internet
        - name: 1                                                               # Name of target pool (converted to "<service>-<name>-target-pool", eg "`web-1-target-pool`")
          ip_protocol: TCP                                                      # IP protocol to which this rule applies (TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP)

          address:                                                              # Dictionary of data related to the associated source external address
            service: base                                                       # Name of service used to create the external address (eg `base`)
            name: 1                                                             # Name of the service's address resource (eg `base-1-address`)
      scopes:
        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute
      fw_data:
        - name: allow-gitlab
          description: GitLab service port
          allowed:
            - ip_protocol: tcp
              ports:
                - '80'
          pri: 65500
```

## Inventory

Instances are created with a label key called `ansible_group` which takes the service name as a value. It is recommended to use a mixture of static and dynamic inventory sources. See [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_gce.html#gce-dynamic-inventory) and [here](https://www.diewufeiyang.com/ansible/en/plugins/inventory/gcp_compute.html) for enabling & further configuration of GCP dynamic inventory.

By adding the following lines to the dynamic inventory YAML file, you will be able to access instances created by this role via the service name.

`<inventory_dir>/inventory.gcp.yml`
```yaml
keyed_groups:
  - prefix: gcp
    key: labels
```

Continuing to use the "web" service as an example, any instance created under the "web" service will allow Ansible to reference them by a group named `gcp_ansible_group_web`, which can easily be added to your inventory file as shown:

`<inventory_dir>/inventory`
```ini
[gcp_ansible_group_web]
```

To make things easier to reference, add the shorter-named group `web` into the inventory file with `gcp_ansible_group_web` defined as children as shown here:

`<inventory_dir>/inventory`
```ini
[web:children]
gcp_ansible_group_web
```

## Bastion SSH Proxy

It is recommended to set up the Ansible controller's inventory vars to allow connectivity to internal instances via the bastion SSH proxy instance by configuring the following inventory variables.

First add the "bastion" groups:

`<inventory_dir>/inventory`
```ini
[gcp_ansible_group_bastion]

[bastion:children]
gcp_ansible_group_bastion
```

Then add the "web" group as a child group to the "sshproxy" group:

`<inventory_dir>/inventory`
```ini
[sshproxy:children]
web
```

Now add the following lines to the "sshproxy" group vars file:

`<inventory_dir>/group_vars/sshproxy/vars.yml`
```yaml
---

ssh_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh
  -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
  -o IdentityFile={{ ansible_ssh_private_key_file }}
  -W %h:%p -q {{ ansible_user }}@{{ groups.bastion[0] }}"'
# Apply proxy ssh arguments when remote host has no public IP address
ansible_ssh_common_args: "{{ inventory_hostname | ipaddr('private') | ternary(ssh_args, '') }}"
ansible_port: 22
```

This will use the first host in the "bastion" group as the SSH proxy to any instances belonging to the "sshproxy" group, which is "web" in the case of this example. If there is no external address associtated with the instance, the SSH proxy arguments `ssh_args` are applied, otherwise a direct connection will be made.
