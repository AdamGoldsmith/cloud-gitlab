# Configure hostnames: to return the desired instance hostname data, default
# is ['public_ip', 'private_ip', 'name']
# Private is useful if you want to connect to all hosts via an SSH bastion proxy

# TODO: Write some notes in the README about this part & how dynamically determining
# the hostname to connect to (private or public) in group_vars/sshproxy/vars.yml
# is based on whether the target has an available public IP address or not.
